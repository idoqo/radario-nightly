## WARNING!
This is heavily under development and does NOT even qualify to be a BETA...
Builds may break...


Each time the app crashes, Sango gets really angry and his rage awakes stars, long presumed to be dead,
and for every okay you press to the ANR dialogs, there is a 1/800x10<sup>-99</sup> chance that your phone may trigger a chain
reaction, creating a rift in the space-time continuum and impacting upon dinosaur extinctions!


tldr; only use if you know what you are doing.

##INSTALLATION

Open the APK file in your device and follow the successive dialogs. If you get an "installation not allowed" warning,
enable Third-party app installation from [Settings > Security > Unknown sources].
